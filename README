Currently only one algorithm IDA* is supported, but in future this list will be expanded

More about IDA* you can read in this pdf:
http://ijcai.org/Past%20Proceedings/IJCAI-93-VOL1/PDF/035.pdf

IDA* is well optimized for puzzles with dimension less than 4x4,
but if greater than calculations can take a lot of time. So this can be used as nice CPU workbench

Source code is available for c++ and perl under BSD license

C++ version is ~50x faster than perl, but requires compilation.
Perl version already contains multi-threaded algorithm that uses all processor cores for calculations

Get source code with simple command:
> git clone git://github.com/chval/Fifteen-Puzzle.git

Then
> cd Fifteen-Puzzle
> cmake .
> make
> ./15puzzle

Requirements:
- cmake;
- boost libs;
- perl (for running scripts).
